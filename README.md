# SmokingGeneExpression
This project evaluates the short-term causal effect of smoking on gene expression in healthy lung tissue using causal inference methods.

Note:
Some of the initial data files I used were too big to upload here, so parts of the code "data preparation" won't run. However, you should be able to run all the other code files.
